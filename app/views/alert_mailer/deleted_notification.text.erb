Hello,

We've just updated the Chicago street sweeping schedules for the <%= Time.current.year %> season, and wanted to let you know that your subscription for <%= @area.name %> has been canceled. (This is because your subscription did not have a specific street address, and because the City's sweeping areas often change from year to year.)

If you'd like to continue receiving alerts for this (or another) area, <%= link_to "please visit our website and re-subscribe", ENV["SITE_URL"] %>.

Cheers,
<%= link_to ENV["SITE_NAME"], ENV["SITE_URL"] %>
